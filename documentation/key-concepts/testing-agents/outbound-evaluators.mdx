description: "This guide walks you through the process of testing outbound calls using evaluators. You'll learn how to retrieve evaluators with phone numbers and execute outbound call tests."

## Overview

Testing outbound calls involves two main steps:

1. Getting the list of evaluators with phone numbers
2. Running the selected evaluators for outbound testing

## Getting Evaluators and Phone Numbers

To retrieve the available evaluators and their associated phone numbers:

1. Use the List Evaluators API endpoint 
2. The response will include both evaluators and their corresponding phone numbers for testing

  "next": "https://new-prod.vocera.ai/test_framework/v1/scenarios-external/?agent_id=4&page=2",
  "previous": null,
  "results": [
    {

      "personality_name": "Hindi, Old, Hearing Issue",
      "phone_number": "+14159976447"
    }
    // Additional evaluators ...
  ]
}
```

## Running Outbound Call Tests

Once you have your list of evaluators and phone numbers:

1. Select which evaluators you want to run
2. Execute the evaluators using the Running Evaluators API
3. The system will automatically make outbound calls to the phone numbers associated with the selected evaluators
4. Monitor the test results through the dashboard
