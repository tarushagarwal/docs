- Checks critical deviations from the expected workflows and tells where it deviated.
- This metric can be found in the list of pre-defined metrics.
- Issues are categorized into:
    - **Type of Issue**: The nature or category of the problem, such as technical errors, user errors, or system limitations.
    - **Scenario**: The specific context or situation in which the issue occurred, helping to understand the conditions that led to the deviation. <br />

- Issues are categorized based on priority:
    - **High Priority**: Issues that need immediate attention and can significantly impact the workflow. Alerts can be set up for these issues to ensure prompt action.
    - **Medium Priority**: Issues that are important but do not require immediate action.
    - **Low Priority**: Minor issues that have minimal impact on the workflow.
    - **Not a Bug**: Identified issues that are not considered bugs and do not require changes.

- **Example**: Suppose an AI customer support agent for a SaaS provider is expected to transfer the call to human in case the customer reports a technical challenge. Now the technical challenge can be login credentials not working. In this scenario, a call transfer is important and failing to do so is a high priority bug.
However, if the technical challenge is internet is not working, then a call transfer is unnecessary. You can mark that scenario as "Not a Bug" and the next time your AI voice agent detects this edge case, you won't be bothered.

- The results of this metric will be listed in its own section in a call as seen below.
