
## Types of Metrics
These are metrics defined by the user. These can be tailored to specific needs and requirements, allowing users to create custom evaluations that align with their unique goals and objectives.
We also support generation of custom metrics based on the user's voice agent purpose. Below is a list of various types of metrics users can pick to evaluate calls.
